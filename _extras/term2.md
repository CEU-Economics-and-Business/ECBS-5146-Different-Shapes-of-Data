title: Term project 2
---

### Format
The term project will delivered in teams, consisting 3 students each. 

### Goal

* You will create a data product suitable for analysis and submit it together with documentation outlining the technical choices you made. The purpose of this assignment is for you to apply all the concepts learned during the course.

* Your grade depends on the number of different tools and concepts you apply and how appropriately you do so. The topic of the data product has no bearing on your grade, but you may want to think about what data you are going to work with in your Capstone Project and work with that.


### High level requirements


* Combine at least two distinct datasets
* Use an example dataset or bring your own
* Persist at least one dataset in a database (SQL or NoSQL)
* Build an ETL data pipeline with Knime 
* Do some data cleaning
* Do some basic analytics or visualization on the end of the pipeline



### Delivery
The project artifacts should be stored and handed over in a folder "Term2" in a GitHub repo (One repo of a team member)

The main artifact submitted is a 4-6 page report (including figures and data citation), with the following requirements:
* documents the solution provided
* documents the the technical choices made
* documents the data model (ER diagram for RDBMS)
* documents the analytics and/or visualization
* indicates which team member did what in the project
* can be a README in your git folder


Artifacts to be submitted:
* Term project report
* Power point presentation - material for a few minutes presentation
* Knime workflow file
* Source files 
* Script (or instructions) of data persistence (sql file in case of a RDBMS)
  
Reproducibility: the project should be reproducible in a straightforward manner. In other words, we should be able to run your code and obtain the same outcome as you. 

### Grading criteria

-	Fitness of the input dataset to the purpose **5 points**
-	Complexity of the input data set **5 points**
-	Usage of concepts used in the class **10 points**
- 	Knime pipeline **20 points**
- 	Using database **10 points**
-	Delivery: Naming, structure **10 points**
-	Delivery: Report **15 points**
-	Delivery: Presentation **10 points**
-	Reproducibility **15 points**

Extra points:
- Using NoSQL in the project
- Using API in the project
- Anything special not covered during the course but, makes sense in the project context


### Submission and deadlines

TDB date - Every material should be committed to GitHub. Link to GitHub will be provided into the Team Google Sheet  (Term project teams)

TBD Date - Teams will present their results into a Zoom session. (Use the Zoom link from Moodle)
* The order of presentation will be by team number
