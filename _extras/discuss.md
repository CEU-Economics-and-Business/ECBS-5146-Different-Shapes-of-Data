## Goal
You will create a data product suitable for analysis and submit it together with documentation outlining the technical choices you made. The purpose of this assignment is for you to apply all the concepts learned during the course. 

Your grade depends on the number of different tools and concepts you apply and how appropriately you do so. The topic of the data product has no bearing on your grade, but you may want to think about what data you are going to work with in your Capstone Project and work with that.

## Constraints
* Combine at least two distinct datasets.
* Do some data cleaning.
* Use an example dataset or bring your own.

## What to submit
1. 2-4 page document (including figures), describing the context of problem and the conceptual model of your data product. The requirements may be written up as user stories. Also mention technical and legal constraints. Due date: **December 10**.
2. Final data product. Submit all data objects with a `datapackage.json` metadata descriptor. If you use a web or server resource, refer to it in the Data Package. Make sure I have access to the resource (need not be public). If applicable, also submit code you used for data cleaning and integration. Due date: **December 31**.
3. 4-6 page report (including figures and data citation) documenting technical choices made. It should least include at least a logical level Entity Relation Diagram. Can be README inside data package. Due date: **December 31**.

Submit the two documents on Moodle, the data product prefereably on GitHub.
