level: 
    - Master's
prerequisites:
    - Data Engineering 1
description:
    content: In Data Engineering 2 we deep dive in advanced topics relevant for Data Analysts, we go beyond the tabular format and discover different shapes of data and the tools supporting these shapes. By the end of the course we aim to build all these new technologies in a comprehensive analytical pipeline.  
    relevance: In Data Engineering 1 we introduced SQL and the related technologies such as Relational Database Management Systems and classical Data Warehouse architectures.
