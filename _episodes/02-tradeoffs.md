title: "Data Architecture Tradeoffs"
teaching: 60
exercises: 30
questions:
- Why 80% of classical Data Warehouse projects fails?
- Why RDBMS is less trendy these days?
- What are the expected characteristics of a data store these days?
- What are the limitation of a classical RDBMS and how the "New tools" are solving these limitations?
objectives:
- Understand the issues around the classical Data Warehouse architecture
- Understand the limitation of RDBMDs
- Understand the social, economical and technological changes after 2010 and the radical changes induced in the data world
- Understand the role of opens source in data world
- Understand distributed systems
- Understand cloud-based systems
- Practice creation of a RDBMS in AWS
keypoints:
- As analyst, you need to understand the architectural challenges of data ecosystems, so that later you can choose the right environment for your analytics. 
- As analyst, you need to setup a central cloud based RDBMS so that you can perform your work in a team setup.

## Installing MySQL in AWS

Getting insights in AWS cloud, has to major goals:
* A data system in cloud enables collaboration during the execution of your term project
* Introducing cloud in practice, helps students to understand the next lecture
