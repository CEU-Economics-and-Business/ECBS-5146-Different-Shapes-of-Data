title: "KNIME"
teaching: 10
exercises: 120
questions:
- How the data science landscape looks like in regard to tools?
- How to implement an end-to-end data analytics workflow?

objectives:
- Introducing KNIME as data analytics tool
- Basic exercises with KNIME
- End-to-end (from data acquisition to visualization) practice exercise

keypoints:
- As analyst, you might want to use an end-to-end data analytics tool (with integration of multiple data sources, data pipelines, advanced analytics etc)
- As analyst, rapid prototyping of your data analytics workflow, opposed to using a programing language (R,Python etc), might be a valuable asset
