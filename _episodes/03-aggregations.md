## Chapter's database

No need to load new data, in this chapter we will use only the birdstrikes table loaded in the last chapter:

## Conditional logic

#### CASE

Syntax form

```
CASE expression
    WHEN test THEN result
    â€¦
    ELSE otherResult
END
```
{: .language-sql}

Lets create a new field based on cost

```
SELECT aircraft, airline, cost, 
    CASE 
        WHEN cost  = 0
            THEN 'NO COST'
        WHEN  cost >0 AND cost < 100000
            THEN 'MEDIUM COST'
        ELSE 
            'HIGH COST'
    END
    AS cost_category   
FROM  birdstrikes
ORDER BY cost_category;
```
{: .language-sql}

<br/><br/>
>## `Exercise1` 
> Do the same with speed. If speed is NULL or speed < 100 create a "LOW SPEED" category, otherwise, mark as "HIGH SPEED". Use IF instead of CASE!

## Aggregations


#### COUNT

Counting the number of records

`COUNT(*)` - counts the number of records

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

`COUNT(column)` - counts the number of not NULL records for the given column

```
SELECT COUNT(reported_date) FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

<br/><br/>
#### DISTINCT

How do we list all distinct states? (Remember last seminar!)

```
SELECT DISTINCT(state) FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

Count number of distinct states

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(state)) FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

<br/><br/>
>## `Exercise2` 
> How many distinct 'aircraft' we have in the database?
{: .challenge} 


<br/><br/>
#### MAX, AVG, SUM 

The sum of all repair costs of birdstrikes accidents

```
SELECT SUM(cost) FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

Speed in this database is measured in KNOTS. Let's transform to KMH. 1 KNOT = 1.852 KMH

```
SELECT (AVG(speed)*1.852) as avg_kmh FROM birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}

How many observation days we have in birdstrikes

```
SELECT DATEDIFF(MAX(reported_date),MIN(reported_date)) from birdstrikes;
```
{: .language-sql}


<br/><br/>
>## `Exercise3` 
> What was the lowest speed of aircrafts starting with 'H'
{: .challenge}

## Grouping

#### GROUP BY

What is the highest speed by aircraft type?

```
SELECT MIN(speed), aircraft FROM birdstrikes GROUP BY aircraft;
```
{: .language-sql}

Which state for which aircraft type paid the most repair cost?

```
SELECT state, aircraft, SUM(cost) AS sum FROM birdstrikes WHERE state !='' GROUP BY state, aircraft ORDER BY sum DESC;
```


<br/><br/>
>## `Exercise4` 
> Which phase_of_flight has the least of incidents? 
{: .challenge} 
<br/><br/>


>## `Exercise5` 
> What is the rounded highest average cost by phase_of_flight?
{: .challenge} 

<br/><br/>


#### HAVING

We would like to filter the result of the aggregation. In this case we want only the results where the avg speed is equal to 50.

```
SELECT AVG(speed) AS avg_speed,state FROM birdstrikes GROUP BY state WHERE ROUND(avg_speed) = 50;
```
{: .language-sql}

Crashbummbang! The correct keyword after GROUP BY is HAVING

```
SELECT AVG(speed) AS avg_speed,state FROM birdstrikes GROUP BY state HAVING ROUND(avg_speed) = 50;
```
{: .language-sql}


<br/><br/>
>## `Exercise6` 
> What the highest AVG speed of the states with names less than 5 characters?
