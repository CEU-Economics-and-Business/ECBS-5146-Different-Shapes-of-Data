<p>The term project will delivered in teams, consisting 3 students each.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will create a data product suitable for analysis and submit it together with documentation outlining the technical choices you made. The purpose of this assignment is for you to apply all the concepts learned during the course.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your grade depends on the number of different tools and concepts you apply and how appropriately you do so. The topic of the data product has no bearing on your grade, but you may want to think about what data you are going to work with in your Capstone Project and work with that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="high-level-requirements">High level requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Combine at least two distinct datasets</li>
  <li>Use an example dataset or bring your own</li>

  <li>Build an ETL data pipeline with Knime</li>
  <li>Do some data cleaning</li>
  <li>Do some basic analytics or visualization on the end of the pipeline</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>
<p>The project artifacts should be stored and handed over in a folder ‚ÄúTerm DE2‚Äù in a GitHub repo.</p>

<ul>
  <li>documents the solution provided</li>
  <li>documents the the technical choices made</li>
  <li>documents the data model (ER diagram for RDBMS)</li>
  <li>documents the analytics and/or visualization</li>

  <li>Knime workflow file</li>
  <li>Source files</li>
  <li>Script (or instructions) of data persistence (sql file in case of a RDBMS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reproducibility: the project should be reproducible in a straightforward manner. In other words, we should be able to run your code and obtain the same outcome as you.</p>
